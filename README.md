## Description

This project is divided into two main folders: `client` and `server`, each containing distinct components of the application.

### Client

The `client` folder houses the Next.js application, responsible for the front-end user interface and client-side logic.

#### Setup and Installation

1. Navigate to the `client` directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

### Server

The `server` folder contains the Node.js backend, handling server-side logic and API endpoints.

#### Setup and Installation

1. Navigate to the `server` directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Configure environment variables as necessary (e.g., database connection strings).
4. Run `npm start` to start the Node.js server.
5. The server will be running on the specified port, typically `http://localhost:YOUR_PORT`.
